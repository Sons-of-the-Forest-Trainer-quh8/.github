## 🎯 What Is a Sons of the Forest Trainer?

A trainer is a powerful tool or standalone EXE that runs alongside your game, letting you toggle game-changing features on/off with simple hotkeys or a mod menu UI. It's not a full-blown cheat engine, but it *still packs serious heat*.

Use it to:

* Break resource limits
* Become invincible
* Kill mutants instantly
* Build anything in seconds
* Explore the map without barriers
